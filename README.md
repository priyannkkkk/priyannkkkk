## 🧠 About Me

I'm **Priyankkumar Dineshbhai Pateliya**, a final-year **Computer Engineering** student at *Madhuban and Bhanubhai Patel Institute of Technology*.  
I’m a passionate learner driven by curiosity and a desire to solve complex, data-driven challenges.  

My focus is on **Data Science** — not just because it’s trending, but because it aligns with my strengths: turning raw data into meaningful insights and accurate future outcomes.  
I’ve built multiple projects that make my daily work easier, such as automated journal systems, expense trackers, and Twitter summarizers.  

Beyond coding, I’m also an **author** of *“Depth of Deliberation”*, a book filled with reflective thoughts and practical lessons for youth, and I often engage in **public speaking**, guiding others on overcoming fear and gaining financial independence.
